# My NeoVim Config

Welcome to my NeoVim configuration! 

This repository houses my own custom setup for Neovim, tailored to my development workflow and preferences. Feel free to use for any text editing, or as inspiration for a config of your own!

### Important Notes:

- **Updates**: While I strive to keep this configuration functional and up-to-date with my latest preferences, I cannot guarantee timely updates to match the newest versions of Neovim or the plugins used.
- **Compatibility**: The setup is tested on my own system and might require adjustments to work seamlessly on different environments. Please review the setup and adjust paths, plugins, and settings as necessary for your system.
- **Feedback and Contributions**: Suggestions and improvements are welcome! However, as this is a personal project, my response time to issues or pull requests may vary.

Happy coding!
